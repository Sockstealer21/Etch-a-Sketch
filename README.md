This project will make a browsert style Etch-a-Sketch using a 16x16 grid of square divs

Using nothing but google, my brain and the basic outline on The Odin Project I'll be creating 
this program from scratch.

I've made other projects in HTML, CSS and JavaScript before and using the knowledge I currently
have and knowledge I'll gain from making this project hopefully I'll be one step closer to 
becoming more competent in these languages.
